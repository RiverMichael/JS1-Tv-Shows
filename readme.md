# JavaScript 1

This is my project for the course: JavaScript 1, at Noroff.

## Description

The assignment was to find a public API and fetch an array of results aswell as a single result using a property such as ID or name.

- We should create an index page, loop through the results and create html for at least 3 different properties.
- Link each result to a details page using a parameter in the query string.
- Retrieve the parameter in the query string on the details page and make an API call using the URL and parameter.
- Display at least 3 different properties retrieved from the JSON on the details page, set the HTML title using one of the property values.
- Create a contact page with a form and use JavaScript validation for the inputs.
